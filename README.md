# WLauncher Manual
WLauncher allows you to quickly connect to the MGE servers, 
while being able to use secure MGE accounts and auto-update 
the game and the launcher itself.

#WLaucnher Developer
If you have access to the GitHub repository, then you are 
a WLauncher developer or an MGE administrator. 
To update the current version of the launcher, there is a 
file in the repository version.txt , the change of which 
entails an automatic installation .rar of the archive from 
the main directory to the computers of all owners of WLaucnher
